Consolidate metadata management into a single shared class (ISA?)
Need real MAGE-TAB parsers for idf/sdrf/adf files
  The heuristic in use right now fails.  A lot.
soft2pcl is a bit iffy, although not nearly so bad as MAGE-TAB
  SOFT parser is solid, question is exactly how to go to PCL from there
Gene ID conversion is currently disabled
  BridgeDB is too incomplete and WAY too slow to be useful
  Its heart is in the right place, but it's not really capable
Downloads are randomly rejected sometimes
  Presumably from too many threads, need to make e.g. a single-retryer?
